# OHDSI Study Design Assistant (in development)

## Overview

The goal OHDSI Study Design Assistant (SDA) is to provide an experience similar to working with a coding agent but for designing and executing observational retrospective studies using OHDSI tools. SDA is designed to organize and enable users to interact with a wide variety of agentic tools to suppor their study work.  It does so by providing a clean separation between the agentic user experience and the generative AI tools. Check out the tag `first_agent_and_strategus` for the first version to assist with Strategus (not validated) as shown in the [more recent video for the second version](https://pitt.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=34ed8cfe-2e4c-40b7-9efa-b40800b75bd5) (no sound). This demonstrates a possible way for the agent to help the user design, run, and interpret the results of an OHDSI incidence rate analysis using the [CohortIncidenceModule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHDSI/Strategus/main/inst/doc/CreatingAnalysisSpecification.pdf) of  [OHDSI Strategus](https://github.com/OHDSI/Strategus). This older [ video](https://pitt.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f802b01f-9bce-4f38-a4c4-b3f800e6ebdd&start=254) shows an prior test of this concept.

### Roadmap

### Near term

- `data_quality_interpretation` : study agent provides interpretation from Data Quality Dashboard, Achilles Heel data quality checks, and Achilles data source characterizations over one or more sources that a user intends to use within a study.  In this mode, the study agent derive insights from those sources based on the user's study intent.  This is important because it will make the information in the characterizations and QC reports more relevant and actionable to users than static and broad-scope reports (current state). Users will use this tool from R initially.

- `create_new_phenotype_definition` : Study agent will guide the user through the creation of a definition for an EHR phenotype for the target or outcome cohort relevant to their study intent. This workflow involves selection of concepts, organization of concepts into concept sets, and assembly into cohort definition logic. In addition to concept retrieval, the agent will support reasoning over the semantic relationships encoded in the OMOP vocabulary system (via identity, hierarchical, compositional, associative and attribute links) to help users identify appropriate inclusions, exclusions, and boundary conditions. This enables deterministic validation of constructed concept sets, supports principled disambiguation of similar concepts during grounding, and provides traceable justification for why specific concepts or groups are included in a phenotype definition. Users will use this tool from R or Atlas initially.
  
- `keeper_design_sample` : Study agent helps the user to create the createKeeper function to pull cases matching a clinical definition. This will guide the user through building the set of symptoms, related differential diagnoses (those that need to be ruled out), diagnostic procedures, complications, exposures, and measurements for the clinical definition. 

### Long term

Build out the entire set of planned services, each one evaluated and user-tested.

## Design 

- An [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/get-started/introduction) (ACP) server that owns interaction policy: confirmations, safe summaries, and tool invocation routing.
   - `acp_agent/`: interaction policy + routing; calls MCP tools or falls back to core.
   
- Multiple MCP servers that own tool contracts: JSON schemas + deterministic tool outputs.
   - `mcp_server/`: exposes tool APIs (core tools plus phenotype retrieval and prompt bundles).

- Core logic stays pure and reusable across both ACP and MCP layers.
   - `core/`: pure, deterministic business logic (no IO, no network).

### Why this architecture matters

ACP provides consistent UX and control across environments (R, Atlas/WebAPI, notebooks), while MCP provides a shared tool bus that can be reused across agents and institutions. ACP orchestrates tool calls and LLM calls; MCP owns retrieval, prompt assets, and deterministic tool outputs. This enables the same core tools can be accessed via MCP or directly by ACP without coupling to datasets or local files.

NOTE: at no time for any of the services should an LLM see row-level data (this can be accomplished through the careful use of protocols (MCP for tooling, Agent Client Protocol for OHDSI tool <-> LLM communication) and a security layer). 


## What is implemented so far?

### Current unit tests 

See `docs/TESTING.md` for install and CLI smoke tests.

### `phenotype_recommendation` flow (ACP + MCP + LLM)

1. ACP calls MCP `phenotype_search` to retrieve candidates.
2. ACP calls MCP `phenotype_prompt_bundle` to fetch prompt assets and output schema.
3. ACP calls an OpenAI-compatible LLM API to rank candidates.
4. Core validates and filters LLM output.

For details on the design, see `docs/PHENOTYPE_RECOMMENDATION_DESIGN.md`.

### `phenotype_improvements` flow (ACP + MCP + LLM)

1. ACP calls MCP `phenotype_prompt_bundle` for improvement prompts.
2. ACP calls an OpenAI-compatible LLM API for improvement suggestions.
3. ACP calls MCP `phenotype_improvements` with LLM output for validation.

This flow reviews one phenotype definition at a time. If multiple cohorts are provided, ACP uses the first.

### `concept-sets-review` flow (ACP + MCP + LLM)

1. ACP calls MCP `lint_prompt_bundle` for lint prompts.
2. ACP calls an OpenAI-compatible LLM API for findings/patches/actions.
3. ACP calls MCP `propose_concept_set_diff` with LLM output for validation.

### `cohort-critique-general-design` flow (ACP + MCP + LLM)

1. ACP calls MCP `phenotype_prompt_bundle` for cohort critique prompts.
2. ACP calls an OpenAI-compatible LLM API for findings/patches.
3. ACP calls MCP `cohort_lint` with LLM output for validation.

### `phenotype_validation_review` flow (ACP + MCP + LLM)

1. ACP calls MCP `keeper_sanitize_row` to remove PHI/PII (fail-closed).
2. ACP calls MCP `keeper_prompt_bundle` and `keeper_build_prompt` for a sanitized patient prompt.
3. ACP calls an OpenAI-compatible LLM API to review the patient summary.
4. ACP calls MCP `keeper_parse_response` to normalize the label.

LLM requests never include row-level PHI/PII; only sanitized summaries are sent.

For details on PHI/PII handling, see `docs/PHENOTYPE_VALIDATION_REVIEW.md`.

### `phenotype_recommendation_advice` flow (ACP + MCP + LLM)

1. ACP calls MCP `phenotype_recommendation_advice` for advisory prompt assets and schema.
2. ACP calls an OpenAI-compatible LLM API to return actionable guidance.
3. Core validates the advisory output.

This flow is used as a fallback when users do not accept initial recommendations.

### Strategus incidence shell (R)

The interactive Strategus shell orchestrates phenotype selection, improvements, and script
generation for a CohortIncidence study. See `docs/STRATEGUS_SHELL.md`.

### Service Registry

Service definitions live in `docs/SERVICE_REGISTRY.yaml`. ACP exposes a `/services` endpoint that
reports registry entries plus any additional ACP-implemented services. You can list services
quickly with `doit list_services`.

#### Example run for `phenotype_recommendation`

*Prerequisite:* you have embedded phenotype definitions - see `./docs/PHENOTYPE_INDEXING.md`

1. Start the ACP server (runs on http://127.0.0.1:8765/ by default):
```bash
export LLM_API_KEY=<YOUR KEY>
export LLM_API_URL="<URL BASE>/api/chat/completions"
export LLM_LOG=1
export LLM_MODEL=<a model that supports completions> 
export EMBED_API_KEY=<YOUR KEY>
export EMBED_MODEL=<a text embedding model>
export EMBED_URL="<URL BASE>/v1/embeddings"
export PHENOTYPE_INDEX_DIR="<ABSOLUTE PATH TO phenotype_index>"
export STUDY_AGENT_MCP_CWD="<REPO ROOT (optional, for stable relative paths)>"
export STUDY_AGENT_HOST=127.0.0.1
export STUDY_AGENT_PORT=8765
export STUDY_AGENT_MCP_COMMAND=study-agent-mcp
export STUDY_AGENT_MCP_ARGS=""
study-agent-acp
```
Note: This starts MCP via stdio. If you use MCP over HTTP, do not set `STUDY_AGENT_MCP_COMMAND`.
Note: Prefer stopping the ACP process (SIGINT/SIGTERM) so the MCP subprocess is closed cleanly. Killing the MCP directly can leave defunct processes.
Note: ACP uses a threaded HTTP server by default. Set `STUDY_AGENT_THREADING=0` to disable threading.
Note: `/health` includes MCP preflight details under `mcp_index` when MCP is configured.
Troubleshooting: run `python mcp_server/scripts/mcp_probe.py` to verify index paths and search without ACP.

### MCP over HTTP (recommended for cross-platform stability)

Start MCP as a separate HTTP service:

```bash
export MCP_TRANSPORT=http
export MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1
export MCP_PORT=8790
export MCP_PATH=/mcp
study-agent-mcp
```

Then point ACP at it:

```bash
export STUDY_AGENT_MCP_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8790/mcp"
study-agent-acp
```
Note: `STUDY_AGENT_MCP_URL` must include the port (e.g. `:8790`). When set, ACP uses HTTP and ignores `STUDY_AGENT_MCP_COMMAND`.

PowerShell (Windows) quickstart:

```powershell
$env:MCP_TRANSPORT = "http"
$env:MCP_HOST = "127.0.0.1"
$env:MCP_PORT = "8790"
$env:MCP_PATH = "/mcp"
study-agent-mcp
```

```powershell
$env:STUDY_AGENT_MCP_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8790/mcp"
study-agent-acp
```

2. Run `phenotype_recommendation`
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/flows/phenotype_recommendation \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"study_intent":"Identify clinical risk factors for older adult patients who experience an adverse event of acute gastro-intenstinal (GI) bleeding", "top_k":20, "max_results":10,"candidate_limit":10}'
```
